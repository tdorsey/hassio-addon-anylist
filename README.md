# Home Assistant Addon For Anylist
This addon allows you to add, remove, and fetch items from your Anylist list using REST APIs, and now also supports recipe management and meal planning. If you're looking for a Home Assistant integration to manage your Anylist lists via intents, service calls, and the [to-do list feature](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/todo), you need to also install the [Anylist custom integration](https://github.com/tdorsey/hacs-anylist).

## Features
- **Shopping Lists**: Add, remove, update, and fetch items from your shopping lists
- **Recipe Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve recipes
- **Meal Planning**: Add recipes to your meal planning calendar


## Installation Methods

### Home Assistant Addon
To install the addon, you have to first add this repository to your Home Assistant addon store. You may do so manually or by clicking the button:


[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftdorsey%2Fhassio-addon-anylist)


### Docker Container
The addon is also available as a docker image. If you prefer to use docker compose, download and import [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/tdorsey/hassio-addon-anylist/blob/main/anylist/docker-compose.yaml) from the repository. Otherwise, you can also run the container by executing the docker command inside [run-docker.txt](https://github.com/tdorsey/hassio-addon-anylist/blob/main/anylist/run-docker.txt) from the repository. 
In both cases, please make sure to replace the placeholder envrionment variables with your actual values. 


## Configuration
This addon supports multiple configuration parameters
| Name        | Description                                      | Required |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Email       | Anylist account email                            | Yes      |
| Password    | Anylist account password                         | Yes      |
| List        | Name of Anylist list if not specified in request | No       |
| IP Filter*  | Allow requests only from specified IP prefix     | No       |

*Note on IP filter: The server performs a simple check on whether the IP address of the request origin starts with the specified value. Leave it blank to allow requests from all IPs.

For example, if you specify "192.168.1." as the filter, the server will only allow requests from the 192.168.1.x subnet.
